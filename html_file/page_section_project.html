          <p>The English proverb ‘when there is a will, there is a way’
             has been my motto to accomplish my ambitions and goals since I was a teenager. 
             My interest in Electrical and Computer Engineering dates back to the days 
             of my elementary school when I was disassembling and repairing it back plus 
             diverting a call of my father’s old phone by the time only a few people was using
              a phone in the community I grew up in. That time I was wondering how was 
              it possible to send a call away from one phone to another and craved to be
               an engineer. Without enough knowledge about the equipment, I used to draw the 
               connections of part of the circuit board on sand. </p>
